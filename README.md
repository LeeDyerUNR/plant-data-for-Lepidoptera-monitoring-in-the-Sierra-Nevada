These are counts of flowers of 336 species of plants at fixed plots ("stations") at our six montane sites, observed biweekly during the flowering season, starting in 2023. Columns of data are detailed below.

Day: day of the month.

Month: month of observation.

Year: year of observation.

site_name: one of six locations.

Zone: habitat breakdown by site, with names mostly arbitrary (e.g., "1Valley") and should be treated as an unordered, categorical variable.

Station: individual locations where 2 x 10 meter plots were placed, within which flowers were counted; note that names of stations are meant as convenient handles and should only be used to link to spatial data (coordinates provided in another data file).

species: identity of plant species being observed.

inflorescences: counts of flowers that are open (accessible to flower-visiting insects).

Observer: initials of individual recording observations.
